# BirthdayWish-1
Udacity Grow With Google - Practice with GitHub and renaming repository
Repo contained incremental changes of sample work
From Tom, Tim, Todd - layout then... tried 
Birthday Wish for Ben &amp; Connecting to my Android Phone (LG G3 Stylus)
Note: Have not tried virtual devices. Was able to get cellphone connected & load app with simple Birthday Wish for Ben.
However, did not commit the project at the time. Argh.
Decided to try setting up a new repository for the "Android Party" pic project.
Renaming this to Tom, Tim, Todd.
